# Temporal UI Access Guide

The Temporal UI provides a visual interface to monitor and debug your workflows.

## Quick Access Link
**[Click here to open Temporal UI](http://localhost:8233)**

## How to Access
1.  Ensure your Docker containers are running.
    *   Run `docker-compose up -d` in your terminal if they are not.
2.  Open your web browser.
3.  Go to `http://localhost:8233`.

## What You Can Do in the UI
*   **View Workflows**: See a list of all running, completed, and failed workflows.
*   **Inspect History**: Click on a workflow ID to see the detailed event history (activity scheduling, task completion, etc.).
*   **Debug Failures**: View stack traces and error messages for failed workflows.
*   **Terminate/Cancel**: You can manually terminate or cancel running workflows from the interface.

## Troubleshooting
*   **"Site can't be reached"**:
    *   Check if the container is running: `docker-compose ps`.
    *   Ensure port `8233` is not blocked or used by another application.
    *   Restart the containers: `docker-compose restart temporal-ui`.
