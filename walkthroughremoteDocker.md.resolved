# Remote Docker Setup Walkthrough

I have successfully configured your application to use the Docker services running on your remote computer (`192.168.178.26`).

## Changes Made
- Created a [.env](file:///Users/charlotteokeyo/Downloads/novel-weaver-studio/backend/.env) file in the `backend` directory.
- Configured `TEMPORAL_HOST` to point to `192.168.178.26:7233`.

### Centralized LLM Configuration
The application now uses a centralized LLM configuration in [backend/.env](file:///Users/charlotteokeyo/Downloads/novel-weaver-studio/backend/.env). All workflow phases (1-7) have been updated to use the `default` keyword, which pulls the provider and model from your environmental settings.

**Default LLM Settings:**
- **Provider:** `openrouter`
- **Model:** `google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05`

### Verification Results
1.  **Remote Connection**: Confirmed connectivity to `192.168.178.26:7233`.
2.  **Worker Start**: The Temporal worker successfully connects to the remote host.
3.  **LLM Configuration**: The backend correctly reads API keys and default model settings from [.env](file:///Users/charlotteokeyo/Downloads/novel-weaver-studio/backend/.env).
4.  **Workflow Flexibility**: All workflows are now model-agnostic and will follow your [.env](file:///Users/charlotteokeyo/Downloads/novel-weaver-studio/backend/.env) configuration.

## Next Steps
1.  **API Keys**: Open [backend/.env](file:///Users/charlotteokeyo/Downloads/novel-weaver-studio/backend/.env) and enter your actual API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or OpenRouter.
2.  **Restart**: Stop and restart the backend and worker:
    - Backend: `uv run python -m src.main`
    - Worker: `uv run python -m src.workflows.worker`

## How to use
You can now start your local backend and worker as usual. They will automatically connect to the remote Temporal instance.

1. **Start Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uv run python -m src.main
   ```
2. **Start Worker**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uv run python -m src.workflows.worker
   ```

You should see them connecting to `192.168.178.26:7233` in the logs.
